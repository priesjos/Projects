                <h2>WHAT IS MUSIC?</h2> 
                <p>
                    Music is the combination of pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and qualities of timbre and texture. Different 
                    genres of music compose tracks that vary in the utilization of these fundamentals, and a myriad of means
                    exist for the composition of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a subject holding a broad number of components with nearly as much depth to them as well, allowing
                    for a means of expression that is unique from other forms of art. It is because of this that music is so 
                    fascinating, and it remains a cornerstone of culture worldwide to this day.

                    A few years back I started learning how to do stuff in FL Studio, a digital audio workstation that's capable
                    of producing many different things.

                <p>
                    You read into music theory a little bit, sound synthesis, sampling, lots more, etc.
