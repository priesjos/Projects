                <h2>WHAT IS MUSIC?</h2> 
                <p>
                    Music is the combination of pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and qualities of timbre and texture. Different 
                    genres of music compose tracks that vary in the utilization of these fundamentals, and a myriad of means
                    exist for the composition of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a subject holding a broad number of components with nearly as much depth to them as well, allowing
                    for a means of expression that is unique from other forms of art. It is because of this that music is so 
                    fascinating, and it remains a cornerstone of culture worldwide to this day.

                <h2>STUDY</h2>
                <p>
                    A few years back I started learning how to do stuff in FL Studio, a digital audio workstation that's capable
                    of producing many different things. Since then, I've read into concepts from music theory, sound synthesis,
                    sampling, and many other fields in order to get a better understanding of working with FL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also been taking a piano class in order to get a more interactive study in melody as well as hands-on 
                    experience with a nice instrument. Many nice sounding chords that I discover come from me freeplaying on a
                    physical piano.
