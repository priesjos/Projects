                <h2>GENRES</h2>
                <p>
                    Speedcore, future funk, minimal techno, house, and a variety of other electronic genres are favorites
                    of mine. I also have a good amount of progressive metal tracks saved that I listened to a lot in the 
                    past. Acid jazz and other jazz-like tracks are also nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of my interests were developed as I was growing up, and I would often sit and listen to music 
                    from the radio or TV when I was very young. The channels on television I went to would range from
                    alternative rock to hardcore metal to electronica, and I often spent hours listening to what was on
                    there.
